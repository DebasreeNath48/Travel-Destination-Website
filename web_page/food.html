        <left><h2 style="color:navy;"><u>One of the most vibrant siblings among the seven sisters in the Northeast is the state of Meghalaya. Blessed with natural beauty and tribal culture, this is the perfect place to spend some quality time with your friends or family members. After the year we have all had, having a vacation in this Himalayan state is something that will rejuvenate your body and mind in the best way possible. While you are exploring the city of Shillong or drenching yourself in Cherrapunji, trying out the local delicacies is highly recommended. The food of Meghalaya is so distinctive that you will be in awe of every dish you devour in any part of this beautiful state. As there are three main tribes in Meghalaya, the food eaten in villages and cities can differ depending on where you are located. For instance, people belonging to the Khasi and Jaintia tribes will have a lot of bamboo shoots in their food preparations. On the other hand, Garos prefer eating a lot of pork-based dishes among other proteins from animals. And yes, there is a lot more than momos!</u></h2></left>

          </header>
          <p>Meghalayan cuisine celebrates pork in all its glory. Be it steamed, boiled, fried or grilled, pork plays a key role in most of the dishes eaten by the local population. One such is Doh-Khleih, which is essentially a salad prepared with minced up pork, green chillies, and onions. Now, this might seem like a pretty simple dish to you but the wow factor is a servicing of pig brains, curry, and bread along with this local delicacy. The sheer magic of this traditional Meghalayan food item is an experience that you need to have on your next trip. While exploring the Police Bazar in Shillong, you can try this pork salad at Trattoria, which is literally a hole in the wall food joint that prepares the most outstanding Khasi dishes in the city.</p>
